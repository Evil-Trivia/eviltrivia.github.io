- Admin dashboard at `/weddingadmin` for managing puzzles and tracking players
- Firebase Realtime Database for storage
- Firebase Cloud Function for secure answer checking

### Setup

   ```
   firebase deploy --only functions:checkWeddingAnswer
   ```

2. Update the Database Rules:
   ```
   firebase deploy --only database
   ```

3. Deploy the hosting configuration:
   ```
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```

### Data Model (Realtime DB)

```
/wedding/
  answers/            # set only from admin page
     1..10:  {answer:"...", clue:"..."}
  progress/
     {uid}/
        name: ""
        email: ""
        currentScreen: 0     # 0-11
        solved: [ falseâ€¦ ]   # index 1-10
  attempts/           # analytics for admins
     1..10: [...]     # attempt records
```
