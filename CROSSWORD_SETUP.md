## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Create Your Crossword

1. **Create your crossword puzzle** using:
   - **Crossword Nexus** (crosswordnexus.com) - exports CFP files
   - **Across Lite** - creates PUZ files
   - **CrossWord Puzzle Redactor** - various formats
   - **Any crossword software** that exports CFP/PUZ/JPZ/iPUZ

2. **Design tips for wedding puzzles**:
   - Use answers related to the couple (names, places, dates)
   - Include a "meta" puzzle with highlighted squares spelling a secret word
   - Keep it moderate difficulty - guests should be able to solve it

### Step 2: Upload Your Puzzle File

1. Save your crossword file as `wedding-crossword.cfp` (or .puz, .jpz, .ipuz)
2. Upload it to: `pages/puzzles/wedding-crossword.cfp`
3. Configure the crossword in the wedding admin panel

### Step 3: Configure Crossword in Wedding Puzzle

1. Go to the wedding admin panel
2. Edit the puzzle you want to make a crossword
3. In the "Crossword" tab, enable crossword mode
4. Set the CFP file URL to your uploaded file
5. Configure completion settings

The crossword will be automatically integrated into the wedding puzzle system with anti-cheat protection and proper styling.

## 🛠️ Customization Options

### Colors & Styling
Modify these values in the crossword configuration:

```javascript
var params = {
  color_selected: '#FFD700',    // Selected cell color
  color_word: '#FEE300',        // Selected word color  
  color_hover: '#FFFFAA',       // Hover color
  // ... more options available
};
```

### Completion Behavior
You can modify what happens when the crossword is completed:

```javascript
function submitFinalAnswer(event) {
  // Your custom completion logic here
  // Could integrate with your existing wedding puzzle system
}
```

### Security Settings
Additional anti-cheating measures are already implemented, but you can add more:

```css
/* Hide any other cheating elements */
.any-cheat-class {
  display: none !important;
}
```

## 📱 Mobile Considerations

The crossword is fully responsive, but consider:

- **Touch interactions**: Work well on tablets/phones
- **Screen size**: Crossword scales appropriately  
- **Keyboard**: Virtual keyboards work fine
- **Performance**: Optimized for mobile browsers

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Crossword doesn't load**
   - Check file path in `puzzle_file.url`
   - Verify file format is supported (CFP, PUZ, JPZ, iPUZ)
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Reveal buttons still showing**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check CSS is loading properly
   - Verify JavaScript isn't overridden

3. **Mobile display issues**
   - Test on actual devices, not just browser dev tools
   - Adjust `crossword-container` height if needed

### Debug Mode:
Add this to enable debug logging:

```javascript
// Add to the top of your script section
window.crosswordDebug = true;
```

## 🎉 Testing Your Setup

1. **Load the crossword page**
2. **Verify no reveal/check buttons appear**
3. **Test on mobile devices**
4. **Try the completion flow**
5. **Verify integration with main wedding puzzle**

## 📝 Example Puzzle Ideas

**Wedding-themed clues:**
- "Where they first met" → COLLEGE
