## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Create Your Crossword

1. **Create your crossword puzzle** using:
   - **Crossword Nexus** (crosswordnexus.com) - exports CFP files
   - **Across Lite** - creates PUZ files
   - **CrossWord Puzzle Redactor** - various formats
   - **Any crossword software** that exports CFP/PUZ/JPZ/iPUZ

2. **Design tips for wedding puzzles**:
   - Use answers related to the couple (names, places, dates)
   - Include a "meta" puzzle with highlighted squares spelling a secret word
   - Keep it moderate difficulty - guests should be able to solve it

### Step 2: Upload Your Puzzle File

1. Save your crossword file as `wedding-crossword.cfp` (or .puz, .jpz, .ipuz)
2. Upload it to: `pages/puzzles/wedding-crossword.cfp`
3. Update the file path in `crossword-puzzle.html` if needed:

```javascript
puzzle_file: {
  url: 'puzzles/wedding-crossword.cfp', // Your file here
  type: 'cfp' // Match your file type
}
```

### Step 3: Integrate with Wedding Puzzle System

In your main `wedding.html`, add a crossword puzzle option. For example, modify the puzzle loading to include:

```javascript
// Add this to your loadPuzzle function around line 1350
if (puzzleNum === 5) { // Or whatever puzzle number you want
  window.location.href = 'crossword-puzzle.html';
  return;
}
```

### Step 4: Customize the Secret Word

In `crossword-puzzle.html`, change the final answer (line 219):

```javascript
const correctAnswer = 'love'; // Change to your secret word
```

## 🎯 Two Implementation Options

### Option 1: Basic Crossword (`crossword.html`)
- Simple standalone crossword
- Basic integration
- Good for testing

### Option 2: Advanced Integration (`crossword-puzzle.html`)
- Full wedding puzzle system integration
- Secret word completion mechanism
- Better mobile experience
- Recommended for production

## 🛠️ Customization Options

### Colors & Styling
Modify these values in the crossword configuration:

```javascript
var params = {
  color_selected: '#FFD700',    // Selected cell color
  color_word: '#FEE300',        // Selected word color  
  color_hover: '#FFFFAA',       // Hover color
  // ... more options available
};
```

### Completion Behavior
You can modify what happens when the crossword is completed:

```javascript
function submitFinalAnswer(event) {
  // Your custom completion logic here
  // Could integrate with your existing wedding puzzle system
}
```

### Security Settings
Additional anti-cheating measures are already implemented, but you can add more:

```css
/* Hide any other cheating elements */
.any-cheat-class {
  display: none !important;
}
```

## 📱 Mobile Considerations

The crossword is fully responsive, but consider:

- **Touch interactions**: Work well on tablets/phones
- **Screen size**: Crossword scales appropriately  
- **Keyboard**: Virtual keyboards work fine
- **Performance**: Optimized for mobile browsers

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Crossword doesn't load**
   - Check file path in `puzzle_file.url`
   - Verify file format is supported (CFP, PUZ, JPZ, iPUZ)
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Reveal buttons still showing**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check CSS is loading properly
   - Verify JavaScript isn't overridden

3. **Mobile display issues**
   - Test on actual devices, not just browser dev tools
   - Adjust `crossword-container` height if needed

### Debug Mode:
Add this to enable debug logging:

```javascript
// Add to the top of your script section
window.crosswordDebug = true;
```

## 🎉 Testing Your Setup

1. **Load the crossword page**
2. **Verify no reveal/check buttons appear**
3. **Test on mobile devices**
4. **Try the completion flow**
5. **Verify integration with main wedding puzzle**

## 📝 Example Puzzle Ideas

**Wedding-themed clues:**
- "Where they first met" → COLLEGE
- "Month of the wedding" → JUNE  
- "Honeymoon destination" → HAWAII
- "First dance song" → (abbreviated)

**Meta puzzle**: Have certain squares spell out "LOVE" or the couple's names when highlighted.
